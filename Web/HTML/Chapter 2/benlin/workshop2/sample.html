    <p>Mohanlal Viswanathan (IPA: [moːhɐnlaːl ʋiʃʋʷɐn̪aːt̪ʰɐn]; born 21 May 1960), known mononymously as Mohanlal, is an Indian actor and filmmaker who predominantly works in Malayalam cinema besides also having sporadically appeared in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada films.[4][5][6] Mohanlal has a prolific career spanning over four decades, during which he has acted in more than 400 films.[5][7] The Government of India honoured him with Padma Shri in 2001,[8] and Padma Bhushan in 2019, India's fourth and third highest civilian honours,[9] for his contributions to Indian cinema. In 2009, he became the first actor in India to be awarded the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army.[10][11] Mohanlal was named as one of "the men who changed the face of the Indian Cinema" by CNN.[12]

Mohanlal made his acting debut at age 18 in the Malayalam film Thiranottam in 1978, but the film was delayed in its release for 25 years due to censorship issues. His screen debut was in the 1980 romance film Manjil Virinja Pookkal, in which he played the antagonist.[13][14] He continued to do villainous roles and rose to secondary lead roles in the following years. By the mid-1980s, he established himself as a bankable leading actor and attained stardom after starring in several successful films in 1986; the crime drama Rajavinte Makan released that year heightened his stardom.[13] Mohanlal prefers to work in Malayalam films, but he has also appeared in other language films. Some of his best known non-Malayalam films include the Tamil political drama Iruvar (1997), the Hindi crime drama Company (2002) and the Telugu film Janatha Garage (2016).[15][16]</p>

He has also appeared in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and English-language productions. In a prolific career spanning five decades, he has appeared in more than 400 films, predominantly in lead roles. He is the recipient of several accolades, including three National Film Awards, eleven Kerala State Film Awards, eleven Kerala Film Critics Awards and fifteen Filmfare Awards South.

Following a series of box office failures, the 1987 crime thriller New Delhi improved his commercial prospects.
